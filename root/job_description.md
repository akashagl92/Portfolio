# Data Science Manager II, Marketing Data Science - Root Insurance

## About Root

At Root, we're on a mission to improve the lives of our customers by offering better insurance solutions. We challenge ourselves to think differently in order to reimagine insurance to make it smarter, more equitable, and a better experience for all.

We strive to "unbreak" the archaic insurance industry by using data and technology in innovative new ways. We believe we must be steadfast in our commitments to research, experimentation, and disciplined data-driven decision making in order to build products our customers love.

## The Opportunity

We believe that a disruptive insurance company must have a principled quantitative framework at its foundation. At Root, we are committed to the rigorous development and effective deployment of modern statistical machine learning methods to problems in the insurance industry.

At Root, the Quantitative Science team owns the majority of all marketing capital allocation, using quantitative methods to test, maintain, and enhance our marketing strategies across numerous distribution channels. As Data Science Manager II on the Marketing Data Science team, you will lead a group of data scientists and marketing specialists responsible for launching campaigns, onboarding partners, and expanding Root's presence in the mid and upper funnel.

You'll drive the end-to-end execution of new marketing efforts, from vendor sourcing and test design to campaign launch and performance evaluation. This role requires close collaboration with internal teams (engineering, product, legal, procurement) and external partners to ensure campaigns are executed efficiently and learnings are captured effectively. The ideal candidate combines strong analytical rigor with fast-paced execution, bringing structure to ambiguity and a clear focus on driving business value through marketing experimentation.

**Salary Range**: $178,419 - $245,326 (Bonus and LTI eligible)
